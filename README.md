# Power BI Superstore Sales Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing the Superstore sales dataset to uncover key business insights through compelling data visualizations.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that effectively tells a story about sales performance, profitability, and customer/product trends. The aim is to master visual storytelling by focusing on actionable business insights rather than just raw data.

## Dataset

* `Superstore.csv`: The core dataset used for this analysis. It contains detailed information on sales, profit, product categories, customer segments, shipping modes, and geographical locations.

## Key Visualizations & Insights

The Power BI dashboard includes a variety of charts designed to provide a holistic view of the Superstore's operations:

* **Overall Sales & Profit Trends:** Line charts illustrating sales and profit performance over time (e.g., yearly, quarterly), revealing seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.
* **Geographical Performance Analysis:** Filled maps and bar charts showcasing sales and profit distribution across different regions, states, and cities, identifying high-performing and underperforming areas.
* **Product Performance Analysis:**
    * **Total Sales by Sub-Category:** A bar chart revealing that **Phones** and **Chairs** are the leading sales drivers. It also highlights the significant sales disparity, with sub-categories like **Envelopes**, **Fasteners**, **Supplies**, **Art**, and **Labels** showing considerably lower sales.
    * Further analysis on `Category` and `Sub-Category` to identify profitable and unprofitable product lines.
* **Customer & Segment Contribution:** Visualizations (e.g., bar charts, tables) to understand sales and profit contributions from various customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and to identify top individual customers.
* **Discount Impact on Profit:** A scatter plot to analyze the correlation between discounts offered and the resulting profit, helping to assess pricing strategies.
* **Shipping Mode Effectiveness:** Charts illustrating the usage and associated sales/profit of different shipping modes.
